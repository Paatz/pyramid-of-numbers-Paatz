# Assignment: Pyramid of Numbers

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to make you familiar with aggregate data types. We do this by implementing a solution for a well-known primary school problem, calculating the pyramid of numbers.

## Materials

- Atom or any other editor
- gcc
- terminal.

## Required Tasks
As described in the [problem statement](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/if-03-22-prpr/if.03.22-03_pyramid-of-numbers/blob/master/assignment/html/index.html).

## Evaluation
All coding assignments will get checked. Most common reasons that your assignment is marked down are:

- Program does not build or builds with warnings
- One or more items in the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read

## Things to Learn
- Using aggregate data types
- Implementing functions
- Reading specifications
- Repeat a bit of algorithmic thinking

## Extra Credit
The required pyramid calculator can only multiply with numbers being a unary digit integer.
Make the pyramid calculator ready to deal with pyramids being wider than 16, i.e., it shall be able to multiply not only by numbers 2 to 9 but 2 to any arbitrary big integer.
